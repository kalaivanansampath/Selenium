How will you schedule automation?

Previously, we used schedule automation from simple Jenkins jobs. Later, we are
using Jenkins Pipeline to trigger the selenium automation tests based on the below
3 different triggers:

a) Regression test suite trigger:

We have closely 500+ automated regression tests than run on every Saturday morning
11 AM IST on 3 different browser (chrome, firefox, edge) and for 2 different data.
This is triggered based on the time !

b) Developer build trigger:

About 50+ end to end sanity automated testcases run on chrome for single test data
on every developer build published on the test environment (triggered based on
dependency build)

c) Test code commit trigger:

Every time, the test automation engineer / myself pushes the code to GitHub, the
webhook trigger all the tests based on the automation by author (my tests alone)
